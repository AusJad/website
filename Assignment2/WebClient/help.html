		<h1>Help Page</h1>
		<p>Right, so you're here because you're either curious about what's on here, or you need some help with the site.  Below, you'll find a step-by-step process to find what you're looking for on the search page.</p>

	<div id="info" class="help">
		<p>Now, the simplest way to find what you're looking for is to scroll through the stock until you find what you're looking for.  However, that way lies madness, for it will take <i>far</i> too long to find what you're looking for.  Here's how to make it quicker.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><h2>Catalogue</h2>
				<img src="images/help1" alt="The bar in the top right of the white bit of the page." style="width:50%;left:12.5%;">
				<p>The most prominent thing on the page is the catalogue.  However, the most important bit to use it is the search bar, which is that bit circled in red.  You select the category that you want to look through, type what you're looking for in the text box, and click the search button.  If anything in our catalogue matches what you searched for, it gets displayed in the big old box beneath it.  Simple.</p></li>
