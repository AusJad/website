 <div id="info" class="help">
  <p>	Now, the simplest way to find what you're looking for is to scroll through the stock until you find what you're looking for.  However, that way lies madness, for it will take <i>far</i> too long to find what you're looking for.  Here's how to make it quicker.</p>
  <ul>
   <li><h2>Search Bar</h2>
       <img></img>
       <p>The most prominent thing on the page is the search bar.  You type what you want to search for in here and click the search button, and if anything in our catalogue matches it, it gets put in the big old box.  Simple.</p></li>
